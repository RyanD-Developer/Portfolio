            <p>
              Hello I'm Ryan, I'm 17 years old and graduated from James Madison High School early at 15, so I decided to become a student at Eastern College, to study my passion, Video Game Development. I love coding, and Video Games so I kind of put 2 and 2 together to figure out what I wanted to do professionally. I know C++, HTML5, a little CSS, C# (unity), Blueprints for unreal, a little JavaScript, and a little Lua. â€‹
              I enjoy mobile games with fun gameplay loops, and I also enjoy games with online multiplayer, so I can play with my friends. My current favorite or at least most played games are Paper.io and Flow free on mobile, and Phasmophobia on PC. <br> <br>
              I know how to use the SDL 2.0 framework, Love2D, Unreal Engine, and Unity, and im also profficient in using nad implementing ChatGPT into my workflow. I have lived in Ontario and Atlantic Canada for most of my life, although I would be happy to move if it meant an opportunity to develop more games. I enjoy coding and gaming a lot, so in my free time, I'm usually working on projects or playing a game.
              The projects I've made solo are (mostly) for class, I've made 3 games in Lua, 2 in Love2D, 1 in in Pico-8, 4 in Unreal Engine, and the most ive made are in unity which combined between class and work at Reframe ive made 8. I've also recreated Frogger in C++ using SDL 2.0. The links for all the games are on each of their pages, you can get to by hitting their buttons on the homepage, except for the Frogger game, that is because I did not want to publish a remake of a copyrighted game on itch.io.</p>
